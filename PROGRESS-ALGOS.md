Recursive progress algos

These are just items of sketch code at the moment.

* Simple: %age complete based on top-level object count
* Cache: %age complete based on file scan cache
* Self-Correcting: %age complete based on continuously improving counts

Q: should I just go ahead and build the Cache version, so I don't spend too long on design?
